# Validate

A validator for the Go `http.Request`.

Gostalt Validate provides an easy-to-use package for validating
form values in Go. With it, you construct a ruleset, and use it
to ensure that an incoming request is satisfied.

## Usage

Firstly, create a number of `Rule` items to check against. Each
rule has a parameter and a callback that is ran to determine if
the Rule passes or not.

Validate ships with a number of [built-in checks] that you can
use:

[built-in checks]: #Validators

```go
alphaForename := validate.Rule{
  Param: "forename",
  Check: validation.Alpha,
}

alphaSurname := validate.Rule{
  Param: "surname",
  Check: validation.Alpha,
}
```

However, you are free to create your own rules by passing a func
to the Check field. The func must be compatible with `CheckFunc`:

```go
type CheckFunc func(*http.Request, string, Options) error
```

Inside the function, you can use the http.Request to extract any
parameters you wish to checkâ€”the second argument to the function
is the parameter, so you can retrieve it dynamically from the
request:

```go
// Below is the built-in Integer validator.
var Integer CheckFunc = func(r *http.Request, param string, _ Options) error {
	fail, _ := regexp.MatchString(`[^0-9]+`, r.Form.Get(param))

	if fail {
		return fmt.Errorf("%s must be an integer", param)
	}

	return nil
}
```

Some validators utilise an `Options` map to provide dynamic checks:

```go
long := validate.Rule{
  Param: "name",
  Check: validate.MaxLength,
  // Max length is 5 characters
  Options: validate.Options{"length": 5},
}
```

You can use the Options map in your own custom validators using
the third argument to the CheckFunc:

```go
// Below is the built-in MaxLength validator.
var MaxLength CheckFunc = func(r *http.Request, param string, o Options) error {
	value := r.Form.Get(param)

	max, ok := o["length"].(int)
	if !ok {
		max = 0
	}

	if len(value) > max {
		return fmt.Errorf("%s cannot be longer than %d characters", param, max)
	}

	return nil
}
```

When you have created all the validators you wish to use against
a request, call `validate.Check`. This accepts an http.Request
and any number of rules, and returns a `Message` and an error:

```go
msgs, err := validate.Check(r, alphaForename, alphaSurname)
```

It may be more succinct to create a variable or function that
contains the rules, and use the spread operator:

```go
msgs, err := validate.Check(r, rules()...)
```

When creating validation as part of a JSON API, you can easily
create a response using `validate.Response` (after checking
whether the validation as failed or not!). All you need to do
is pass in a ResponseWriter and the failed validation messages:

```go
validate.Response(w, msgs)
```

This will automatically write a `422 Unprocessable Entity` header
and a `Content-Type: application/json` header to the response,
then, the errors will be wrapped in an `error` object:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "forename": [
        "forename is required",
        "forename must be longer than 5 characters"
      ],
      "surname": [
        "surname must be longer than 5 characters"
      ],
      "dob": [
        "dob does not satisfy date format 2006-01-02"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Of course, you can manually interact with the `msgs` variable
that is returned from the `Check` method if you need to carry
out additional logic or handling of failed validation.

## Validators

Validate offers a number of built-in validators:

### Alpha

Fails if the parameter contains any characters that aren't in the
alphabet.

### Alphanumeric

Fails if the parameter contains any characters that are not an
alphabet letter or a number.

### Boolean

Fails if the parameter is not a boolean. Because request params
do not have a type, this validator fails if the value of the
param is not equal to `"true"`, `"false"`, `"1"` or `"0"`.

### Date

Fails if the parameter is not a date. This validator uses the
built-in Go date formats to check if the passed value is a date.
You can also pass a slice of strings as a `formats` key in the
Options struct.

### DateFormat

Fails if the parameter does not matched the `format` key's value
passed in the Options struct.

### Email

Fails if the parameter is not an email address.

### Integer

Fails if the parameter is not an integer. Uses the regex `^[0-9]+`
to determine a pass.

### MaxLength

Fails if the length of the parameter (number of characters) is
greater than the `length` value passed to the Options struct.

### MinLength

Fails if the length of the parameter (number of characters) is
less than the `length` value passed to the Options struct.

### NotRegex

Fails if the parameter is satisfied by the regex `pattern` passed
to the Options struct.

### Regex

Fails if the parameter does not satisfy the regex `pattern` passed
to the Options struct.

### Required

Fails if the parameter does not exist in the request.

### RFC3339

Fails if the value passed does not match the date pattern defined
by RFC3339.
